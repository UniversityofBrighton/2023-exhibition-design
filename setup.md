During the tutorial we will use established methods and frameworks to practice how to manage a digital exhibition/experience design project from the stage of its conception to the stage of its conceptualisation through a storyboard. 

For these, you will need to access to one of the following resources: 

- Persona builder template: [files/project-canvas.pdf (in our sharepoint) 
- Project canvas: [PDF template]()
- [Miro editable template](https://miro.com/templates/project-canvas-2/) (you will need to create an account) 
- Storyboard building: [PDF template](https://museumsvictoria.com.au/media/6716/making-history-storyboard-tempate.pdf)
